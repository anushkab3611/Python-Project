# PYTHON PROJECT

This project is a simple, menu-driven Python application for managing patient health records using file storage and dictionaries. The system allows users to add, view, and manage patient visit data including vital signs like temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.

## Key Features

- Read and store patient visit data from a text file
- Add new patient visits with automated input validation
- Display individual or all patient records
- Calculate and display average statistics for vital signs
- Search visits by year or month
- Identify patients who may need follow-up based on abnormal vital signs
- Delete all visit records for a specific patient

This project demonstrates use of Pythonâ€™s file handling, dictionaries, exception handling, and basic data analysis for healthcare applications.
